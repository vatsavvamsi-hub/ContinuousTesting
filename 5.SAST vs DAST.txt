SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
•  Analyzes source code, bytecode, or binaries without executing the application
•  Tests from the "inside out" - examines the code structure itself
•  Runs early in development (during coding/build phase)
•  Finds vulnerabilities like SQL injection, buffer overflows, hardcoded credentials in the code
•  Pros: Catches issues early, pinpoints exact code locations
•  Cons: Can't detect runtime or configuration issues, may have false positives

DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
•  Tests the running application by simulating attacks from the outside
•  Tests from the "outside in" - treats app as a black box
•  Runs later in development (during testing/pre-production)
•  Finds vulnerabilities like authentication flaws, server misconfigurations, session management issues
•  Pros: Tests real-world attack scenarios, no false positives from actual exploits
•  Cons: Slower, doesn't show exact code locations, requires deployed app

Key difference: SAST examines the code itself; DAST attacks the running application.
