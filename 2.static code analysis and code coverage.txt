where do static code analysis and code coverage happen in a cicd pipeline ?

Static code analysis and code coverage typically happen at these stages in a CI/CD pipeline:

## Static Code Analysis
- **Early in CI pipeline** - Usually runs immediately after code checkout and dependency installation
- **Before building/compiling** - Catches issues before resources are spent on builds
- **On pull requests** - Provides feedback to developers before code is merged
- **Common placement**: After linting but before tests

## Code Coverage
- **During test execution** - Coverage data is collected while unit/integration tests run
- **After all tests complete** - Coverage reports are generated and analyzed
- **Before deployment stages** - Used as a quality gate to prevent deployments if coverage is too low

## Typical Pipeline Order
1. Checkout code
2. Install dependencies  
3. **Static analysis** (linting, security scans, complexity analysis)
4. Build/compile
5. **Run tests with coverage collection**
6. **Generate coverage reports**
7. Quality gates (fail if coverage/analysis thresholds not met)
8. Deploy to staging/production

## Best Practices
- **Fail fast**: Run static analysis early to catch issues quickly
- **Parallel execution**: Run static analysis and tests in parallel when possible
- **Quality gates**: Use coverage/analysis results to block deployments
- **Caching**: Cache analysis results to speed up subsequent runs

Both help maintain code quality but serve different purposes - static analysis catches potential issues without execution, while coverage ensures your tests adequately exercise your code.
