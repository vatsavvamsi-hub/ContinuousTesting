Test case management tools like Tricentis work by providing a centralized platform for organizing, executing, and tracking software testing activities. Here's how they typically function:

Core Components

Test Case Repository: Stores all test cases with detailed steps, expected results, and metadata like priority, test type, and requirements traceability.

Test Planning & Organization: Creates test suites, test cycles, and execution schedules. Groups related tests and assigns them to team members.

Execution Management: Provides interfaces for manual test execution with pass/fail tracking, defect logging, and evidence capture (screenshots, logs).

Automation Integration: Connects with automation frameworks to trigger automated tests and import results back into the management system.

Key Workflows

1. Test Design: Create and maintain test cases linked to requirements or user stories
2. Test Planning: Organize tests into execution cycles based on releases or sprints  
3. Execution: Run tests manually or automatically, recording results and capturing defects
4. Reporting: Generate coverage reports, execution summaries, and quality metrics
5. Traceability: Track relationships between requirements, test cases, and defects
